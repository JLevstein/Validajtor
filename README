This is the BNOTIONS Validajtor (not a misspelling).

To begin, please follow the steps below:

1. Add the following to your custom javascript file:
$('form').validajte({
	'labelpos' : 'absolute',
	'ajax' : false
});

Replacing -form- with the id of your form.

2. If you want a form element to be required then add this attribute to it "data-validation='{"required":true}"

3. You can continute to add to your validation by specifying the type as well "data-validation='{"required":true, "type":"email"}"

Types are defined by jquery.validajtor.js. The types currently supported are:

- Email
- Minimum length and mix of characters password
- Date
- Zip/Postal Code
- Matching inputs
- Custom word validation

4. To add two elements that need to match, please refer to the following code: 
<input type="email" name="email" id="param_email" data-validation='{"required":true, "type":"email", "match":"param_email2"}' required="required">

<input type="email" name="email2" id="param_email2" data-validation='{"required":true, "type":"email"}' required="required" >

5. To add in a custom error message: 

data-validation='{"required":true, "message":"Please enter your first name"}'

6. Custom word validation

data-validation='{"required":true, "regexp":"(yellow|green)", "message":"Prove you are human" }'

7. Have a great time.
